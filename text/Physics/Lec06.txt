4  7 0 Energy is a state variable of a system, an abstract concept compared to Newton’s Laws.  the ability to do “work”. 0 Every physical process that occurs in the Universe involves energy and energy transfers or transformations. 0 Useful to analyze the problems where the force is not constant or well-defined. Why Energy? 0 No need to know the details of the forces. 0 Energy is a scalar; force is a vector. 0 A more profound physics can be understood by the energy approach. Lagrangian Mechanics: L K – U. K: kinetic energy Hamiltonian Mechanics: H K + U. U: potential energy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian)  8
