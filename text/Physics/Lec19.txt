3 Internal Energy  Internal energy is all the energy of a system that is associated with its microscopic components (atoms and molecules)  viewed from a reference frame at rest with respect to the center of mass of the system. The bulk kinetic energy of the system due to its motion through space is NOT included in internal energy.   In general,  Internal energy = thermal energy (kinetic energy relative to C.M.) + bond energy (potential energy).  Thermal energy is associated with random motion of molecules and, therefore, related to temperature. Random translational motion Rotational motion Vibrational motion  Bond energy is the intermolecular potential energy, related to latent heat or the energy required for phase transition. 

6 State Variables  State variables describe the state of a system.  In the macroscopic approach to thermodynamics, variables are used to describe the state of the system, e.g., Pressure (P), temperature (T), volume (V), internal energy (Eint), particle number (N).  The macroscopic state of an isolated system can be specified only if the system is in thermal equilibrium internally.   Transfer Variables  Transfer variables are zero unless a process occurs in which energy is transferred across the boundary of a system.  Transfer variables are not associated with any given state of the system, only with changes in the state. Heat (Q) and work (W)are transfer variables.  

Energy transfer mechanisms in thermal processes The First Law of Thermodynamics  The First Law of Thermodynamics is an extension of the Law of Conservation of Energy.  The First Law of Thermodynamics states that Eint = Q + W. Eint is a state variable. Q and W each are dependent on the path, BUT Q + W is independent of the path.  

Various thermodynamics processes 6. Energy transfer mechanisms in thermal processes (1) Isolated Systems  An isolated system is one that does not interact with its surroundings. No energy transfer by heat takes place. The work done on the system is zero. Q = W = 0, so Eint = 0 The internal energy of an isolated system remains constant.  
[Page 11]
11  A cyclic process is one that starts and ends in the same state. This process would not be isolated. On a PV diagram, a cyclic process appears as a closed curve. The internal energy must be zero since it is a state variable. Eint = 0, Q = W. (2) Cyclic Processes   (3) Adiabatic Process  An adiabatic process is one during which no energy enters or leaves the system by heat Q = 0, Eint = W  This can be achieved by: 1. Thermally insulating the walls of the system. 2. Having the process proceed so quickly that no heat can be exchanged. If the gas expands adiabatically (but not for freely expansion), the temperature of the gas decreases.  

[Page 13]
13 (4) Adiabatic Free Expansion  Because the gas expands into a vacuum, it does not apply a force on a piston and W = 0. Q = 0 and W = 0, Eint = 0 and the initial and final states are the same. No change in temperature is expected.     For nonideal gases, some temperature change occurs during free expansions, even though the internal energy is constant. For such a gas in a free expansion, the temperature usually drops.  int 0 K E U      
[Page 14]
14 (5) Isobaric Processes  An isobaric process is one that occurs at a constant pressure (Path D). The values of the heat and the work are generally both nonzero. The work done on the gas is W = – P (Vf – Vi), where P is the constant pressure.   (6) Isovolumetric (isochoric) Processes  An isovolumetric process is one in which there is no change in the volume (Path A). Since the volume does not change, W = 0. From the first law, Eint = Q.  
[Page 15]
15 (7) Isothermal Process  An isothermal process is one that occurs at a constant temperature.  Since there is no change in temperature, Eint = 0. Therefore, Q = W. Q 0 in an isothermal process.  Because it is an ideal gas and the process is quasi-static, PV = nRT and  f f i i f i V V V V V V nRT W PdV dV V dV nRT V       l n i f V W nRT V            (Don't confuse it with .)

23   The adiabatic process PVγ = const. is valid only for equilibrium states.
