25 Supercooling and superheating  If liquid water is held perfectly still in a very clean container, it is possible for the water to drop below 0˚C without freezing into ice. This phenomenon, called supercooling. If supercooled water is disturbed, it suddenly freezes. The system drops into the lower-energy configuration of bound molecules of the ice structure, and the energy released raises the temperature back to 0˚C. Commercial Hand warmers are an example.  It is also possible to create superheating. For example, clean water in a very clean cup placed in a microwave oven can sometimes rise in temperature beyond 100˚C without boiling because the formation of a bubble of steam in the water requires scratches in the cup or some type of impurity in the water to serve as a nucleation site.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMSxuORKynI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph8xusY3GTM  https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1799173086925334
