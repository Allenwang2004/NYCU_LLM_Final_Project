Entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics Reversible and Irreversible Processes  A reversible process is a process that the system can return to its initial state along the same path, with no increase in entropy. It must have the following features. 1. Every point along the path is in a “nearly equilibrium state” so that its state can be identified in the process. 2. No dissipative effects that convert mechanical energy to internal energy, e.g., no friction or turbulence (i.e., no nonconservative effects).  An irreversible process does not meet the above requirements. All natural processes are known to be irreversible. 
[Page 4]
4  A real process that can be a good approximation of a reversible one must occur very slowly quasi-equilibrium and without energy dissipation. Spontaneous process, which is not in an equilibrium state, is irreversible, e.g., heat flows from hot to cold substances and adiabatic free expansion. No dissipation in the process does not mean it is reversible, for example, the adiabatic free expansion case. It also has to occur slowly in order to be reversible.  (Non-equilibrium) Irreversible (Quasi-equilibrium) Quasi-reversible Temperature change due to not thermal equilibrium is irreversible.

5 Adiabatic free expansion is an “irreversible” process. It requires exchange of W and Q in order to return to the initial state. During “free expansion”, the intermediate state is not in a equilibrium state; the path can’t be described in the PV diagram.    A real process that is a good approximation of a reversible one will occur very slowly. The system is always very nearly in an equilibrium state.

10 Heat Engine  A heat engine is a device that takes in energy by heat and, operating in a cyclic process, expels a fraction of that energy by means of work. The working substance absorbs energy by heat from a high temperature energy reservoir (Qh). Work is done by the engine (Weng). Energy is expelled as heat to a lower temperature reservoir (Qc).     A heat engine can also operate in a cycle with more than two reservoirs so that all the heat transfers do not occur at the maximum and minimum temperatures.

22 Carnot Engine  A theoretical engine developed by Sadi Carnot.  A heat engine operating in an ideal, reversible cycle (now called a Carnot cycle) between two reservoirs is the most efficient engine possible. All real engines are less efficient than the Carnot engine because they do not operate through a reversible cycle, which causes additional energy dissipation.  Carnot’s Theorem: 1. All the reversible engines operating between two given reservoirs have the same efficiency. 2. No real heat engine has a greater efficiency than a reversible engine operating between the same two temperatures (reservoirs).     For maximum heat-engine efficiency, all irreversible processes must be avoided as possible. For example, heat flow through a finite temperature difference is an irreversible process, and some of the heat may lose to other places instead of converting to work unless it is adiabatic. Therefore, the engine cycle involving isothermal and adiabatic can be quasi-rerersible and will be favored for maximizing the engine efficiency, which are exactly the design of Carnot cycle.
[Page 23]
23   If not in isothermal processes, there will be temperature difference between the hot reservoir and the engine.

All Carnot engines operating between the same two temperatures will have the same efficiency, which could be used as the definition of Kelvin temperature.  In order for the processes in the Carnot cycle to be reversible, they must be carried out infinitesimally slowly, which will make the engine output power extremely small.

43 Q: An ideal gas is taken from an initial temperature Tito a higher final temperature Tf along two different reversible paths: Path A is at constant pressure; Path B is at constant volume. The relation between the entropy changes of the gas for these paths is (a) SA > SB (b) SA = SB (c) SA < SB.   Ans:(a). From the first law of thermodynamics, for these two reversible processes, Qr Eint W. During the constant-volume process, W = 0, while the work W is nonzero and negative during the constant-pressure expansion. Thus, Qr is larger for the constant- pressure process, leading to a larger value for the change in entropy. In terms of entropy as disorder, during the constant- pressure process, the gas must expand. The increase in volume results in more ways of locating the molecules of the gas in a container, resulting in a larger increase in entropy. 

46  One way of conceptualizing a change in entropy is to relate it to energy spreading. A natural tendency is for energy to undergo spatial spreading in time, representing an increasing in entropy. [Serway, P.574]    The total entropy (engine + environment) change in a Carnot cycle is zero, because of its reversibility. However, other cycles such as Otto, Stirling … involve some irreversible processes and the total entropy change is greater than zero, where the environment entropy increases but the engine entropy remains unchanged in a cycle.

47 Microscopic Entropy and the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics  Entropy is a measure of the probability of microstates (or degrees of freedom) in a system, representing the level of uncertainty, choice, and possibility in a system.. ln B S k W  W : numbers of “microstates” for the macrostate of a system. Entropy (microscopic):  (Boltzmann)    Entropy is a state variable. The entropy change is path-independent. Another statement of the second law of thermodynamics:  Law of increase of entropy The entropy of a closed system increases in all irreversible processes, S > 0. p.s., For reversible process, S = 0.

48 Microstates vs. Macrostates  A microstate is a particular configuration of the individual constituents of the system.  A macrostate is a description of the conditions from a macroscopic point of view.

If we consider a system and its surroundings to include the Universe, the Universe is always moving toward a macrostate corresponding to greater disorder.

The state of perfect disorder implies that no energy is available for doing work. This state is called the heat death of the Universe.  
