10 A system’s energy can be stored in various forms: 1. Kinetic energy (motion). 2. Potential energy (elastic, electric, gravitational, chemical, nuclear; by conservative forces). 3. Internal energy (microscopic kinetic and potential energies relative to system’s center of mass, related to temperature).  19 Ways to Transfer Energy 0 Work – transfers by applying a force and causing a displacement of the point of application of the force. 0 Mechanical Waves – allow a disturbance to propagate through a medium. 0 Heat – is driven by a temperature difference between two regions in space. 0 Matter Transfer – matter physically crosses the boundary of the system, carrying energy with it. 0 Electrical Transmission – transfer is by electric current. 0 Electromagnetic Radiation – energy is transferred by electromagnetic waves.  20

13  25  1. Conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by Noether's theorem as a consequence of continuous time translation symmetry; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time. 2. Energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem 0 When work is done on a system and if the only change in the system is in its speed, the net work done on the system equals the change in kinetic energy of the system.
