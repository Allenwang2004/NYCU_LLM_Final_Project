10 Kinetic Theory 0 Model gas behavior using Newton’s laws of motion to describe thermodynamic processes. To understand “pressure” and “temperature” 19  Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas 0 The number of molecules in the gas is large, and the average separation between the molecules is large compared with their dimensions. The volume of molecules is negligible. 0 The molecules obey Newton’s laws of motion, but as a whole they move randomly. 0 The molecules interact only by short-range forces during elastic collisions. 0 The molecules make elastic collisions with the walls. 0 All molecules are identical. 20

Therefore, the motion of the gas container doesn’t change the gas temperature!  28 For molecules, the rotational and vibrational motions can contribute to the pressure as well.

18 Complex Molecules 0 For molecules with more than two atoms, the vibrations are more complex. The number of degrees of freedom is larger. The more degrees of freedom available to a molecule, the more “ways” there are to store energy. This results in a higher molar specific heat. 35  36 4. Specific heat of an ideal gas and a solid  1.

21 DuLong-Petit Law 0 At high temperatures, the molar specific heat of solids approaches the value of 3R. 0 The molar specific heat of a solid at high temperature can be explained by the equipartition theorem.

Why don’t we smell perfume immediately when the bottle is just opened? 0 A molecule moving through a gas collides with other molecules in a random fashion, sometimes referred to as a random‐walk process. 0 The average distance between collisions is called the mean free path. 0 The mean free path increases as the number of molecules per unit volume decreases. 55  56 The number of collisions # in t is equivalent to the number of molecules in the cylinder. 2 # ( ) : number of molecules per unit volume d v t n n     d d 2d
