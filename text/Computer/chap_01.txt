Overview 1.1 Computer Systems 1.2 Programming and Problem Solving 1.3 Introduction to C++ 1.4 Testing and Debugging  Algorithms An algorithm is a sequence of precise instructions that leads to a solution the actions to execute and the order in which the actions execute Program: expressed an algorithm in a language the computer can understand Problem solving phase (flow thinking) Implementation phase (translation)

Problem Solving Phase Analyze the problem carefully to find: What is the input? What information is in the output? How is the output organized? (format) Develop the algorithm before implementation What if you solve this problem manually?? (idea) Make sure this saves time in getting your program to run (analysis) Test the algorithm for correctness on more cases  Implementation Phase Translate the algorithm into a programming language Easier as you gain experience with the language Compile the source code Locates errors in using the programming language Run the program on sample data Verify correctness of results Results may require modification of the algorithm and program

Overview 1.1 Computer Systems 1.2 Programming and Problem Solving 1.3 Introduction to C++ 1.4 Testing and Debugging  C++ History C was derived from the B language by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs in the 1970s. Used to maintain UNIX systems Today, most operating systems are written in C/C++ C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Bell Labs in the 1980s. Overcame several shortcomings of C Incorporated object oriented programming C remains a subset of C++ (backward compatible) Why the ‘++’ ? ++ is an operator in C++ and results in a cute pun

C++11 C++11 is the most recent version of the standard of the C++ programming language Approved on August 12, 2011 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) C++11 language features are not supported by older compilers Make sure the tool in hand support those new features Check the documentation with your compiler to determine if special steps are needed to compile C++11 programs e.g. with g++, use extra flags of –std=c++11  A Simple C++ Program  #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() { int numberOfPods, peasPerPod, totalPeas; cout << "Press return after entering a number.\n"; cout << "Enter the number of pods:\n"; cin >> numberOfPods; cout << "Enter the number of peas in a pod:\n"; cin >> peasPerPod; totalPeas = numberOfPods * peasPerPod; cout << "If you have "; cout << numberOfPods; cout << " pea pods\n"; cout << "and "; cout << peasPerPod; cout << " peas in each pod, then\n"; cout << "you have "; cout << totalPeas; cout << " peas in all the pods.\n"; return 0; }

Program Layout  Often begin this way … Often end this way … #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() { variable_Declartions Statement_1 Statement_2 ... Statement_Last return 0; } Explanation of code (1/4) Include Directives -- #include <iostream> Tells compiler where to find information about items used in the program iostream is a library containing definitions of basic I/O functions (ex: cin and cout) using namespace std; Tells the compiler to use names in iostream in a “standard” way  To begin the main function of the program int main() { … } The unique start point for each program To end the main function -- return 0; Each function ends with a return statement

Explanation of code (2/4) Variable declaration line int numberOfPods, peasPerPod, totalPeas; Identifies names of three variables to name numbers int means that the variables represent integers Variables are declared before they are used Typically variables are declared at the beginning of the program ask for storage space in advance Statements (not always lines) end with a semi-colon  Explanation of code (3/4) Program statement for output results cout << “Press return after entering a number.\n”; cout (see-out) used for output to the monitor Think of cout as a name for the monitor “<<“ points to where the data is to end up ‘\n’ causes a new line to be started on the monitor Program statement for input data cin >> numberOfPods; cin (see-in) used for input from the keyboard Think of cin as a name for the keyboard “>>” points from the keyboard to a variable where the data is stored

Explanation of code (4/4) Program statement totalPeas = numberOfPods * peasPerPod; Performs a computation ‘*’ is used for multiplication ‘=‘ causes totalPeas to get a new value based on the calculation shown on the right of the equal sign Looks similar to mathematical equations?? They are called “executable” statements with clear “actions” You will learn more actions in the following chapters  Overview 1.1 Computer Systems 1.2 Programming and Problem Solving 1.3 Introduction to C++ 1.4 Testing and Debugging

Testing and Debugging Bug A mistake in a program Difficult to find where it hides Debugging Eliminating mistakes in programs Term used when a moth caused a failed relay on the Harvard Mark 1 computer. Grace Hopper and other programmers taped the moth in logbook stating: “First actual case of a bug being found.” Make sure you have tested the program completely  Program Errors Syntax errors Violation of the grammar rules of the language Discovered by the compiler Error messages may not always show correct location of errors, but should be nearby Run-time errors Error conditions detected by the computer at run-time Logic errors Errors in the program’s algorithm Most difficult to diagnose Computer does not recognize such errors

Get Hints from Compiler Messages  If you cannot compile and run, read error messages and check: Typo: wrong variable names or commands Library: missing #include, wrong library name or namespace Semicolon: missing semicolon often indicates to the previous statement Still failed … Try another computer or call for help Success!! // Testing Your C++ Setup #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() { cout << "Testing 1, 2, 3\n"; return 0; } Is Your Program Correct ? Murphy‘s Law: If anything can go wrong, it will … Run the program on several data sets and check results Have more confidence if those tests are passed Still not an absolute guarantee for correctness The program may fail at some other data Train yourself to consider all possible cases in the program flow and write program carefully Good disciplines may help software engineering
