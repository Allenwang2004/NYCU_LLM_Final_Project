2 Multiple Random Variables Quite naturally, we definitely will have to deal with multiple RVs in a real-world problem:  The total amount of time we need to wait in the line at the supermarket counter  What information can the multiple antennas of a WiFi router provide to the receiver? Again, we are particularly interested in the following:  How different random variables are related to each other? 不同隨機變數間之關聯性 (正相關、負相關、零相關、獨立、條件機率、條件期望值、條件機率密度函數)  How to learn the behavior of the sum of all RVs? Ex: 分析網路系統中資料流量進出某網路節點所耗費的時間延遲(排隊理論, queueing)  How to learn the behavior or the true value of one RV when it is buried in the sum with other random variables? Ex: 如何從接收訊號(Y)=傳送訊號(S)+雜訊(N) 中擷取S 的資訊。其中雜訊一般是 continuous RV，在數位通訊的技術下，傳送訊號S 是discrete。接收訊號Y 為連續。

3 Conditioning on an Event Definition Similar to the definition of unconditional PDF, the conditional PDF of a continuous random variable X, conditioned on a particular event E with P(E) > 0, is a function fX|E that satisfies (1) Special Case Conditioning on the event E that X belongs to a subset A of the real line, we have (2) Therefore, comparing (2) with (1), we have
[Page 4]
4 Illustration of Conditioning on an Event Special Case Conditioning on the set when X belongs to a subset A of the real line, we have We see it’s just a scaling of fx(x). So the PDF within the conditioning set has the same shape as the unconditional PDF

5 Example: The Exponential Random Variable Is Memoryless Example 3.13 (Memoryless Property of Exponential) The time T until a new light bulb burns out can be modeled by an exponential random variable with parameter λ. Alice turns the light on, leaves the room, and when she returns, t time units later, finds that the light bulb is still on, which corresponds to the event A={T>t}. Let X be the additional time until the light bulb burns out. What is the conditional CDF of X, given the event A?

6 Total Probability Theorem Using Conditional PDF** If A1,A2, . . . , An are disjoint events with P(Ai) > 0 for each i, that form a partition of the sample space, then 這是常用的技巧，可協助計算出複雜X 的PDF。 How to justify the equation? See Example 3.14 in the textbook Another example: Let X be a standard normal random variable. A new random variable Y is defined as follows: We flip a coin. If the outcome is a head, then Y= X. And if the outcome of the coin flip is a tail, then 𝑌𝑌= −𝑋𝑋. Assume the coin flip is independent with X. Please find the PDF of Y.

7 Total Probability Theorem using Conditional PDF (Example 3.14) The metro train arrives at the station near your home every quarter hour starting at 6:00 a.m. You walk into the station every morning between 7:10 and 7:30 a.m. and your arrival time is a uniform random variable over this interval. What is the PDF of the time you have to wait for the first train to arrive?

8 Total Expectation Theorem using Conditional Expectation Definition The conditional expectation is defined by Total Expectation Theorem If A1,A2, . . . , An are disjoint events with P(Ai) > 0 for each i, that form a partition of the sample space, then See Example 3.17 in textbook.

10 Joint Probability Density Function We say that two continuous random variables associated with a common experiment are jointly continuous and can be described in terms of a joint PDF fX,Y , if fX,Y is a nonnegative function that satisfies for every subset B of the 2-dimensional plane. The probability that (X,Y) falls within a rectangle is
[Page 11]
11 Joint Probability Density Function  PDF fX,Y(x,y) must satisfy normalization equation, i.e.  To interpret the PDF, we let δ be very small and consider the probability of a small rectangle. We have we can view fX,Y (a, c) as the “probability per unit area” in the vicinity of (a, c)
[Page 12]
12 Marginal PDF from Joint PDF The marginal PDFs fX(x) and fY(y) of continuous X and Y are given by Recall that for discrete random RVs, we have 本質上，上述諸式均源自於total probability theorem
[Page 13]
13 Expectation  If X and Y are jointly continuous random variables, and g is some function, then Z = g(X, Y) is also a random variable. the expected value rule is  Using the expected value rule, for any scalars a, b, we have
[Page 14]
14 Conditioning on a Random Variable Definition Let X and Y be continuous random variables with joint PDF fX,Y. For any fixed y with fY (y) > 0, the conditional PDF of X given that Y = y, is defined by 1. Analogous to the formula in the discrete PMF case 2. fX|Y(x|y) is a legitimate PDF (check normalization) See example 3.19 in the textbook.

18 Total Expectation Theorem Total expectation theorem for continuous random variable  Consider any event A. Let X be the random variable that takes the value 1 if event A occurs and the value 0 otherwise (Such RV is called an indicator). In this case, we have E[X]=P(A) . Then, we have the following version of total probability theorem, when conditioned on continuous random variable Y (See page 30 of this topic)
[Page 19]
19 Independence Two continuous random variables X and Y are independent if their joint PDF for all x and y is the product of the marginal PDFs: Suppose X and Y are independent.  Similar to the discrete case, the random variables g(X) and h(Y) are independent, for any functions g and h  We have or more generally,  IF X and Y are independent, we have

21 Statistical Inference using Bayes’ Rule 使用貝氏定理進行預測、推論  Unobserved phenomenon (cause) describes something we want to know about. But we can only observe a certain result (effect) at the receiving end. For example,  Unknown transmitted bit (0 or 1) in a communication system  Unknown presence of an airplane in a radar system  Unknown disease of a patient  Objective: (藉由觀察Y 的值來推論X 或N 的值。此處Y是蒐集獲得之資料、訊號) Determine which cause among many candidates is the most likely, by checking the posterior probability PN|Y(n|y) for all possible n (or posterior density fX|Y(x|y) ) Measurement Inference Transmission Medium Unobserved phenomenon Case 1: Continuous X Case 2: Discrete N Case 1: Continuous fX|Y(x|y) Case 2: Discrete PN|Y(n|y) Observed (Measured, Received) Typically continuous Y

22 Statistical Inference using Bayes’ Rule 1. Continuous case: The unobserved phenomenon is a continuous random variable X, the posterior density of the unknown X given observed Y=y is 2. Discrete case: The unobserved phenomenon is a discrete random variable N, the posterior probability of N given the observed Y=y is Measurement Inference Transmission Medium Unobserved phenomenon Observed (Measured, Received) Typically continuous, due to noise in the observation Y Case 1: Continuous X Case 2: Discrete N Case 1: Continuous fX|Y(x|y) Case 2: Discrete PN|Y(n|y)

23 Example – Signal Detection in Communication Systems** A binary signal S is transmitted, and we are given that P(S = 1) = p and P(S = −1) = 1−p. The received signal is Y = N+S, where N is normal noise, with zero mean and variance σ2, independent of S. What is the probability that S = 1, given that we have observed Y=y ?

24 Joint CDF If X and Y are two random variables associated with the same experiment, we define their joint CDF by  The joint CDF  The PDF can be recovered from the PDF by differentiating:

25 Joint PDF of Independent Gaussian RVs Let X and Y be two independent Gaussian random variables with means μx ,μy, and variances σx 2, σy 2 respectively. The joint PDF is given by  The joint PDF has a bell shape centered at (μx ,μy). Whether the PDF is a tall-thin bell or wide-fat bell is determined by the variances σx 2, σy 2  Very often we are interested in knowing the contours (等高線圖、切面圖) of the joint PDF. The contours are sets of points at which the PDF takes a constant value.

Summary of Total Probability Theorem and Its Variants We have already learned several different versions of total probability theorem. The original version is given in the form of probability of events (Section 1.4, page 28) According to the types of underlying RVs in forming G and Fi, the TPT can be further generalized to the following variants: Variant 1: Discrete RV in G – Discrete RV in Fi (DD Type) Variant 2: Continuous RV in G – Continuous RV in Fi (CC Type) Variant 3: Continuous RV in G – Discrete RV in Fi (CD Type) Variant 4: Discrete RV in G – Continuous RV in Fi (DC Type) 通則: When continuous RV is involved, the sum and PMF in original TPT need to be modified to integral and PDF 26 1 ( ) ( | ) ( ) K i i i P G P G F P F = =∑
