Probability  Definition Mathematically: A random variable is an assignment (i.e., a mapping or, a function) of a real number to each sample point (i.e., outcome) in the sample space, or a function that maps sample space into the real line 簡言之，隨機變數是一個函數。 Example: Flip a coin. We can define a random variable X, in a way that X(H)=1 and X(T)=0 What is Random Variable (RV)?
[Page 3]
Probability  隨機變數是一個函數，它將樣本空間中的每一個outcome 對應到某一個特定的實數 Concept: It’s not merely a variable; it has a sense of randomness in it “Randomness” lies in the sample space in the sense that, before conducting an experiment, we are uncertain which outcome the experiment will produce. More precisely, it’s a function Performing an experiment yields a specific sample point (outcome) ω, which produces a sample value, say x = X(ω), by means of the random variable. (Be aware of the difference between the capital letter X and the small letter x) 一般我們用斜體大寫(X)表示隨機變數，斜體小寫(x)表示這個隨機變數的一個可能實數結果 What is Random Variable?

Probability  For mathematical convenience We can describe complicated events using simple math expressions by means of random variables (化繁為簡) Particularly useful when outcomes of the considered experiment do not involve with any numerical values, e.g. coin flips (Heads, Tails) Example: Flip a coin 3 times. Define the random variable Xi=1 if the ith flip comes Heads, and Xi=0 if Tails. →F={Two heads in 3 flips} F= 𝑋𝑋1, 𝑋𝑋2, 𝑋𝑋3 : 𝑋𝑋1 + 𝑋𝑋2 + 𝑋𝑋3 = 2, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖= 0 or 1 ; 更簡潔一點的寫法是F={ X1+X2+X3=2 } →G={1st flip is a head, 2nd and 3rd flips have different results} G={ X1=1, X2≠X3 } →Every event has its particular physical meanings, and can be described precisely and elegantly by properly designed random variables (functions) Why the Notion of “Random Variable”?

Probability  Use the previous sample space of two rolls of a four sided dice: ω =(ω1,ω2), ωi = value of the ith toss The following functions are all random variables: R = outcome of the first toss, R(ω) = ω1 S = outcome of the second toss, S(ω) = ω2 X = product of two faces, X(ω) = ω1 × ω2 Y = (difference)2, Y(ω) = (ω1 - ω2)2 Examples

Probability  A function of a random variable defines another random variable Since a random variable (RV) is a just function。再取一次函數，則其定義域為原樣本空間，值仍為一實數 下圖例: X 是一個隨機變數，Y=g(X) 也是一個隨機變數，只是將樣本空間內元素對應到不同的值!  It is to the designer’s convenience to define different RVs on a single experiment R and S in the previous example are the most straightforward We can use R and S to describe the other random variables, e.g., X=RS 對隨機變數取函數運算(Function of An RV)
[Page 8]
Probability  隨機變數與事件之間的關係  When a random variable takes on a specific real value or belongs to certain set, it constitutes an event. Example 1: X=4 in the previous example (X=RS) means the event that the product of two rolls is 4  For a random variable X and a specific value x, { X=x } is an event. Thus, we can find the probability associated with this event. Conditional probability and concept of independence starts to kick in with RVs: Ex: P(R=1|X=4)=?  更廣義而言，一個或多個隨機變數間的運算(等式、不等式、屬於)結果均會對應到一個事件 Ex: (1) R + S= 6 所對應到的事件為何? (2) 𝑅𝑅∈{2,4,6} 表示結果為偶數的事件 隨機變數與事件 這是一個事件
[Page 9]
Probability  隨機變數可分為兩類: 離散與連續  Discrete random variables (離散隨機變數, Chapter 2) Discrete random variables are defined over discrete experiments Ex 1: 丟銅板: X(正面)=1、X(反面)=0 Ex 2: 下棋比賽: X(Type 1對手)=0、X(Type 2對手)=1、X(Type 3對手)=2 離散RV值域裡的值一定是「可數的」。 個數可以是有限個，或是「可數的」無窮多個(如整數一般)。  Continuous random variables (連續隨機變數, Chapter 3) Ex 1: 幸運旋轉盤指針所指結果X 可以是0到1之間的任何實數 Ex 2: 羅密歐與茱麗葉的遲到時間X 和Y 可以是0到1之間的任何實數 Ex 3: 雷達系統接收到由飛機反射回來的訊號Y 可以是任意實數 Ex 4: 手機收到的訊號Y 可以是任意實數 連續RV值域裡的值一定是「不可數的」。個數一定是無窮多個(如實數一般)。 隨機變數的分類

Probability   A random variable is called discrete if its range is finite or at most countably infinite  A discrete random variable is characterized through the probabilities of the values it can take  Probability Mass Function (PMF) of a discrete RV X: 機率質量函數 If x is any possible value of a discrete RV X, the probability mass of x, denoted pX(x), is the probability of the event {X = x} consisting of all outcomes that give rise to X equal to x: pX(x) = P({X = x}) = P({ω: X(ω) = x}) Ex: 投擲公正骰子，X 為其出現點數pX(6)=? We will simply use P(X = x) to represent P({X = x}) 機率質量函數和離散隨機變數是綁在一起的 Probability Mass Function (PMF) Probability of the event {X=x}
[Page 12]
Probability  Remarks:  Comments on the notation pX(x) = P(X = x) Subscript X is the random variable of interest, it’s capital and italic The argument x is the real numerical value that the random variable X may take  With PMF, we can use the third axiom of probability (additivity) to compute the probability of any event involving the random variable P( ) = ∑x∈S pX (x) This is an event!
[Page 13]
Probability  General Rule of Finding PMF  Collect all the sample points in the original sample space that give rise to the mapping X=x for a fixed x. Find the set in the original sample space Sx={ ω: X(ω) = x }  Compute the probability of this set using the original probability measure pX(x) = P( { ω: X(ω) = x } ) =∑ω∈Sx P( {ω} ) If pX(x) is a PMF, then it must satisfy 0 ≦pX(x) ≦1 for all x ∑x pX(x) = 1 上述兩條件可被用來驗證一個PMF 是否被正確計算出來，合乎規範(legitimate)

[Page 15]
Probability  Uniform PMF A uniform PMF puts equal probability on all sample points. Suppose a random variable takes on N possible values 0,1,…,N-1, equally likely. Then, A uniform PMF provides a good model in experiments where there is no reason to suspect that any outcome is more or less likely than any other. Common examples: 1. Flipping a fair coin 2. Rolling a fair dice

Probability  Bernoulli Random Variable: Let X take values only on {0,1} with P(X=1)=p. The probability mass function is called Bernoulli PMF and is given by Bernoulli 的應用 Bernoulli RV 可用來描述某件事情成功或失敗，這種單純的二元事件。如: 1. 銅板(正面、反面): pX(正面)=0.5 2. 子瑜是否答應晚餐邀約: pX (答應)=0.3、pX (拒絕)=0.7 3. 無線通訊網路中資料傳輸成功與否: pX (成功)=0.9、pX (失敗)=0.1 Questions ?

Probability  Binomial PMF Binomial Random Variable: Let X = number of heads in n independent coin tosses. P(正面) = p (bias of the coin) What is the PMF pX(x) of X ? Note that for x = 2, n = 4 pX(2) = P(HHTT) + P(HTHT) + P(HTTH) + P(THHT) + P(THTH) + P(TTHH) = 6p2(1-p)2 Binomial PMF In general, binomial X with parameters (n,p) has PMF
[Page 18]
Probability  Binomial PMF  Binomial 的應用 Binomial RV 可用來描述某件事在n 次的試驗中成功的次數，參數為n 和p。例如: 1.邀約子瑜晚餐10次中成功6次的機率? (n=10, p=0.3) 2. 資料傳100次中成功95次的機率? (n=100, p=0.9)  We can describe a binomial random variable using Bernoulli random variables!! 假設以Bernoulli Xi 表示第i 次試驗的結果，Xi(成功)=1 ，Xi(失敗)=0，且P(Xi=1)=p。則binomial RV Y with parameters (n,p) 可表示成

Probability  Geometric Random Variable Geometric Random Variable: Flip a coin with a bias p until you get the first head. The random variable X defined as the number of flips required is called geometric random variable. pX(1) = P(H1) = p pX(2) = P(T1H2) = (1-p) p pX(3) = P(T1T2H3) = (1-p)2p Geometric PMF: In general, geometric RV 可用來描述嘗到第一次成功所需要實驗的次數。 the PMF is given by pX(k) = (1-p)k-1p, for k=1, 2, 3, … Question: Is it a legitimate PMF?

Probability  Poisson Random Variable** Poisson PMF: A discrete random variable X taking on nonnegative integers is called Poisson random variable with parameter λ if its PMF is given by Questions: 1. Is it a legitimate PMF? 2. What are the applications of Poisson random variables?
[Page 21]
Probability  Poisson PMF 怎麼得來的? Poisson is good approximation for binomial with n large, p small and np a moderate fixed value λ. Introduced by French mathematician Simeon-Denis Poisson in 1837 Consider a binomial random variable with (n, p) such that 1) n→∞ 2) p→0 3) np=λ

Probability  Applications of Poisson Random Variables Poisson random variable is typically used to model the number of occurrences of rare events, e.g. — number of typos in a book — number of phone calls arriving in an interval of T seconds — number of customers being served by a bank teller in an hour — number of packets in a network received at a router in T seconds We will see more applications of Poisson in later chapters (Chapter 6).

Probability  Functions of Random Variables (Revisited) Function of a random variable is also a random variable. Consider a random variable X. We define a function Y = g (X) of the random variable X, such as X2,｜X｜, cos (X) , or e3x Then, as discussed earlier, these are also random variables defined on the original experiment by Y (ω) = g ( X (ω )). 問題是，若已知X 的PMF，如何求得Y 的PMF呢?
