Probability   A random variable X is a function defined on the sample space of an experiment  The PMF of a discrete RV X : You need to find pX (x) = P(X = x) for all x  Given a random variable X and a function g(.), we can define a new random variable Y = g(X), i.e., Y (ω) = g(X (ω)) is a mapping from ω to a real number The PMF of Y can be computed from the PMF of X : Review

Probability  Expectation Definition The expected value E[X] (also called the average value, expectation, or mean 期望值、平均值) of a random variable X, with PMF pX(x), is defined by Example What is the expected value of rolling a fair dice? 物理意義: The expected value can be regarded as the representative sample value (代表值) of an R.V. (e.g. the average score in a class). It needs not be exactly identical to a possible value of the R.V.

Probability  Variance Definition The variance （變異數）of X is defined as the expected value of the random variable (X − E[X])2  物理意義: The variance provides a measure of dispersion (散亂程度) of X around its mean.  Standard deviation (標準差) is defined as the square root of the variance  實務上，怎麼計算variance呢?

Probability  如何計算變異數Variance  土法煉鋼法：𝐸𝐸[ 𝑋𝑋−𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 2] 令 Y=(X-E[X])2，找出Ｙ的PMF，則可用期望值的定義計算E[Y]，即是var(X)。  進階作法: 使用Expected Value Rule Expected Value Rule (或稱Law of the unconscious statistician, LOTUS) Let X be a random variable with PMF pX(x), and let g(X) be a real-valued function of X. Then 令g(X) =(X-E[X])2 代入上式求解。 上述LOTUS 好用之處: 可直接使用X 的PMF來計算期望值，不需要g(X) 的PMF

Probability  Expectation for Functions of Random Variables LOTUS Let X be a random variable with PMF pX(x), and let g(X) be a real-valued function of X. Then,  This result is extremely useful. It tells us, to find E[g(X)], we don’t actually need the PMF of g(X). Instead, knowing the PMF of X can do the trick. Using the expected value rule and letting g(X)=(X − E[X])2, we have the variance of X Similarly, the nth moment of X is Check the proof of LOTUS on page 85 of the textbook

Probability  More on Variance  Variance of X can be expressed in terms of its first 2 moments1 這個式子為計算variance最常用的公式。  Variance of X is always nonnegative which yields the fact that 1Definition for Moments Sometimes we are interested in finding E[Xn ], which is called the n-th moment of the R.V. X. 也就是 E[X2] 是2nd moment，E[X7]是7th moment

Probability  Mean and Variance of a Linear Function of X Let X be a random variable and let where a and b are given (non-random) scalars. Then, Remark: Expectation is a linear operator, but variance is not.
